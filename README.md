# Mobile-Device-Programming
README
Our team has decided to create a mobile version of a fast food application. This is where customers can look at our menu items, add them to their cart, and check out thier order. Kitchen staff and servers  should be able to see online orders as they are being made online so they can anticipate customer needs. Servers wil also have thier side of the app where they will be able to recieve an view existing orders as well as update their order status.
